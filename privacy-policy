Math Number Puzzles: Privacy policy
Welcome to the Math Number Puzzles for Android!

This is an puzzle Android app developed by me, Pranjal Baishya. I love puzzles, so I develpoed this game as a project for my Engineering college.

I don't have any login or signup functionality in my app. There is no way to and not any intention of mine to store and use my user's data.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data lioke game progress created by the you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
Pranjal Baishya
